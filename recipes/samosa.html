    <h1>Samosa Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/samosa.jpeg" height="600px" width="700px">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you think of an “Indian snack”, probably the first image that pops into mind is the humble Samosa.</p>

    <p>These little fried parcels of flaky-yet-tender pastry, stuffed to the brim with spiced potatoes and other ingredients, are pretty much my idea of the world’s greatest savoury snack.</p>
    
    <p>Not only are they insanely delicious, but they’re also incredibly versatile. Samosas can be served as appetisers, entrees, or a lunch on the move. They’re good hot or at room temperature. They keep for days and days, and they reheat well. What is not to love?!?</p>
    
    <p>Finding a great Samosa though, is no easy feat – whether they’re bought or recipes. Most are “OK” but never quite get there for me. So I set myself the (not-insignificant!) challenge of creating my own ideal Samosa recipe.</p>
    
    <p>And so, after many rounds of testing, eating, rethinking and (yes!) eating some more, I’m happy to report I’ve finally arrived at this recipe – my idea of the perfect Samosa!</p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ajwain seeds</li>
        <li>Amchur</li>
        <li>Asafoetida</li>
        <li>Black Musturd seeds</li>
        <li>Garam Masala</li>
        <li>Cumin seeds and powder</li>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>Green chilies</li>
        <li>Ghee</li>
        <li>potatoes</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How To Make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rough-mashed potato – Boil potatoes until tender, then use a fork to roughly mash. It’s nice to have bits of chunks in the potato for interest, rather than a soft, creamy and uniform mash;</li>
        <li>Cook spices and aromatics – A healthy dose of spices are fried up with fresh ginger and chilli which is then tossed through along the peas;</li>
        <li>Add potato – Add the mashed potato and gently but thoroughly mix through, so the flavouring fully permeates the potato; and</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander, then cool – Lastly, mix through fresh coriander, then let the filling cool completely before using.</li>
        <li>Mix dry ingredients, add ghee – Mix the flour, Ajwain seeds and salt, then pour the ghee or oil in;</li>
        <li>Rub fat in – Use your fingers to rub the ghee in until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs. This is the step that gives the Samosa pastry the signature flakiness we know and love so much!</li>
        <li>Form dough, rest 30 minutes – We then add water until it is wet enough to form a dough. The dough should be soft and pliable, but not so sticky that it sticks to your hands. Form a ball and let it rest for 30 minutes;</li>
        <li>Divide – Form a log, then cut into 6 equal pieces;</li>
        <li>Shape dough into balls;</li>
        <li>Roll out balls to 2mm thick – Roll the dough balls into discs 2mm thick. They should be about 16cm /6.5” in diameter.</li>
        <li>Cut in half – Use a small knife to cut a circle in half. Work with one disc of dough at a time. Keep the others covered under cling wrap so they don’t dry out</li>
        <li>Brush disc with water along half the straight edge you just cut;</li>
        <li>Fold one side in</li>
        <li>Form cone – Then fold the other side in, overlapping by about 1cm / 2/5″, to form a cone shape. Press joined edges together to secure</li>
        <li>Fill cone – Form an “O” with your thumb and forefinger, then place the cone inside (like at the holders at the ice cream shop). Fill with the spiced potato filling;</li>
        <li>Fry until golden brown, on low heat.</li>
    </ol>
